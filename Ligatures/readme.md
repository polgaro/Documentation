# Step by step guide on configuring ligatures

First, download a font that has ligatures, I personally like **Cascadia Code**. I use it on my Windows Terminal already.

You can download **Cascadia Code** from: https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/releases

Currently, the latest one is 2009.22 (https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/releases/download/v2009.22/CascadiaCode-2009.22.zip)

Just unzip it, and install the font.

Then, in Visual Studio, go to Tools, Options:

Then go to Fonts and Colors

And then just swap Consolas for your new font:

Done, your environment should be using ligatures now :)
